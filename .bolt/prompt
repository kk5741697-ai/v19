also must be note this, don't create unnecessary files, update the current files, if needed to create files then only create new file, else don't mash up things/codebase. if has duplicate file remove them, also don't replace/rename files, it's makes more problems to other things.

Make operations simple, essential, and frustration-free.

No duplicate or irrelevant options ‚Üí only show what‚Äôs needed for the tool context.

Keep UI consistent and intuitive: both beginners and professionals should complete tasks without tutorials.

Preview canvas & sidebar should be scalable and reusable for 2000+ tools.

I am building an advanced Image/PDF tools platform (similar to ilovepdf.com and iloveimg.com), but I want to make it the best in the world with 2k+ tools planned in the future.
Currently, my layout is:

Left side canvas/preview (main working area for image/PDF).

Right sidebar tools/options (inputs, sliders, selectors, settings, presets, etc) but keep in minimun which are essentials only, other things can be done from the left side canvas/preview.
This base structure is good, but I want it to be much richer, easier, faster, and more interactive for users.

üîπ Current Tools to Complete & Optimize

Image Tools

Background Remover

Image Compressor

Image Converter (JPG ‚áÑ PNG ‚áÑ WebP, etc.)

Image Cropper (‚ö†Ô∏è only single file allowed for precision cropping, with adjustable transform handles as like iloveimg.com)

Image Resizer (with presets like % scaling, pixel input, aspect ratio lock/unlock (1 input changed to other will be auto updated), social media sizes)

Image Rotator/Flipper

Image to PDF

Image Watermark (text + logo watermark, opacity, position, repeat pattern option)

PDF Tools

PDF Compressor

PDF Merger

PDF Password Protector (lock/unlock)

PDF Splitter (by pages, range, bookmarks)

PDF to Image (select resolution/quality, export as ZIP if multiple pages)

PDF Watermark (text + image watermark, position, opacity, tiling option)

üîπ Enhancements & UX/UI Improvements

Responsive & Mobile-first UX: Ensure every tool works seamlessly on mobile/tablet with gestures (pinch-to-zoom, drag, rotate with touch).

Live Preview Always Visible: The canvas should instantly reflect all edits/changes (no hidden steps).

Drag & Drop Everywhere: Support drag-and-drop for uploads, rearranging PDF pages, resizing images, and placing watermarks.

Undo/Redo + Reset Tool: Every tool should have quick undo, redo, and reset options for safety.

Smart Auto-Save: Work-in-progress is cached in browser (local storage) so users don‚Äôt lose progress.

Prebuilt Presets/Templates: For common use cases (e.g., Instagram story crop, YouTube thumbnail resize, LinkedIn profile size, A4 PDF export).

Multi-language & RTL Support for global adoption.

Loading/Processing UX: Instead of boring loaders, use skeleton previews or animated progress with estimated time.

Multi-file batch support where it makes sense (e.g., compression, conversion, merging) but keep single-file only for precision tools (e.g., cropping, watermark placement, page editing).

Cloud Save & Share: Export to Google Drive, Dropbox, or share via link.

üîπ Special Notes

For cropper and other single-image tools, restrict to only one file at a time to avoid messy crop regions.

Ensure transform controls are smooth (resize handles, drag area, rotate angle).

All tools should feel like professional desktop apps but simple enough for a beginner.

Always prioritize essential, useful functionality over adding "just another option." and keep options in canvas/preview  for better expreience by adjusting or button clicking not with manual input only - this makes more dificulties.

also you need to update the home page and the header

you know that this site are multi-domain with single codebase

my domains
PixoraTools.com (global domain, this will be hold all the tools) - bydefault
PixoraPDF.com - all pdf related tools - inspired by https://www.ilovepdf.com/
PixoraIMG.com - all image related tools - inspired by https://www.iloveimg.com/
Pixoraqrcode.com - qr code generator as like https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/ 
PixoraNet.com - Network related tools - 
PixoraSeo.com - Seo Related Tools - inspired by https://smallseotools.com
PixoraCode.com - Code Related tools - inspired by https://codebeautify.org/htmlviewer
Pixorautilities.com - Utilities related tools



it always should be like this
@components/image-tools-layout.tsx
@components/pdf-tools-layout.tsx
@components/text-tools-layout.tsx
@components/code-tools-layout.tsx

not like this
@components/simple-image-tools-layout.tsx
@components/enchanced-image-tools-layout.tsx
@components/simple-pdf-tools-layout.tsx
@components/enchanced-pdf-tools-layout.tsx
or other files also be like this, because no need to rename unncessary for same things.



------------


@app/*
@components/*
@hooks/*
@lib/*


enhance the overall functionality, features, hassle free of all tools
also fix all the problems of overall all the tools, because no any tools all the functionality and features are not working smoothly and perfectly.
and also check for function errors, syntax errors etc problems can be happend.
-------------------
i  have attached some screenshorts also, you need to make improvements our current tools features, functionality, UI/UX etc.

--------------

also currently the codebase has much more problems eg: syntax issue, function issue, import issue etc.

--------

all tools process must be client side, not server side process, it can save the much more server resources.
you need to handle more better way to keep constenticy.
